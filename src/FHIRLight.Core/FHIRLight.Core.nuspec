    <summary>The main library for FhirLight. Contains logic from Spark.Engine which Furore made, but all of the MongoDB logic is removed so it's easier to make Fhir services which have different data sources.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>Have changed some of the logic for conformance. The logic is not quite right yet, but at least now it is possible to change publisher name and description of a service. The text can be changed in the web.config running the service.</releaseNotes>
