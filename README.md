# FhirLight
Is a fork of Furores Spark (https://github.com/furore-fhir/spark). 
FhirLight is a lightweight WebApi project which is easy to integrate with a service with several datasources.

The goal is to support the latest STU from nuget along with FhirPath

Currently more of the code needs to be rewritten to be more futureproof. As the code is now, it might break if the STU is revised.
